# Apriori_BigBasket
This repository provides an implementation of the Apriori Algorithm for association rule mining, commonly used in market basket analysis and frequent pattern mining. The notebook processes a transactional dataset to extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on support, confidence, and lift.
Using the apyori library, the implementation automates the discovery of meaningful relationships between items in large datasets. This technique is widely applied in retail analytics, e-commerce recommendations, and business intelligence.

The notebook includes:
✔ Data preprocessing and formatting for transaction-based analysis.
✔ Applying the Apriori Algorithm to extract frequent itemsets.
✔ Generating association rules to identify strong correlations.
✔ Visualization and interpretation of the results.
